# UI

User-Interface Library, it is meant to be shared between projects that use react-native or react-native-web (for either next.js | cra).
You can add optional dependencies and check them asynchronously for code that should be executed in only one platform.

Be mindful of some gotchas like SVGs and Fonts.

This package provides an Isolated development enviroment using storybook and makes the user capable of developing without needing
to spin up a react-native instance or compile the app, providing a web environment for blazing fast development.
